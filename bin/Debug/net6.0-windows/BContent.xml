		<categories>1. WHAT IS A CHIMPANZEE</categories>
		<description>The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known simply as chimp, is a species of great ape native to the forest and savannah of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo are classified in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans' closest living relative. The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more robust than the bonobo, weighing 40–70 kg (88–154 lb) for males and 27–50 kg (60–110 lb) for females and standing 120 to 150 cm (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in).

The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more.

The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees' tea parties, circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength, aggressiveness and unpredictability makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees, with limited success.</description>

		<description>Chimpanzees are one of our closest extant, living, relatives. Let us look closer at their classification and evolutionary history to understand how this has happened. Ordering animals into a particular classification is the way by which scientists organize and understand how animals are related to one another.

Humans and Chimpanzees are in the same kingdom, phylum, class, order, and family. This meaning that they are both animals who possess backbones, are endothermic (can maintain their own body temperature) and have mammary glands as well as hair or fur. They are both primates which includes all primate species,  and are in the same family which includes all of the great apes including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. Humans and chimpanzees only differ in their genus and species, which simply means that humans and chimpanzees are not exactly identical in all characteristics, but that they are exceedingly similar in many ways. But exactly how did humans and chimpanzees become so closely related?

Most classification over the years has been done based on homologous, or shared similar traits, between animals. It makes it easier for scientists to determine what we humans have in common with other species, but this is not the only way to clearly see the close relatedness of humans and chimpanzees.

All primates share a common ancestor, a relative who lived before them from which the primate including chimps and humans evolved. The Hominoid common ancestor existed somewhere between 8 and 5 million years ago, just think about how long ago that was! Evolution is the process by which our genetic material, the part of biology that makes people unique, changes through time. Humans and chimps diverged from one another roughly around 6 million years ago.

There is evidence in the form of fossils and genetic composition, which supports the theory that, other than the bonobo, the chimpanzee are our closest living relative.  Fossil evidence has come from all over the world to support the evolution of humans from other hominid species, but there has been a particular hot spot in Africa. This is very interesting since many primate species including the chimpanzees and gorillas are found in Africa. Olduvai gorge, Laetoli, and the Great Rift Valley were all very famous paleontological sites where fossils have been found. Many fossils have appeared to be half human and half chimpanzee, giving us another reason to believe that we are very closely related to chimps.  A common location from which we all seem to stem supports the notion that we are very closely related to chimpanzees.</description>

		<description>Chimpanzees is one of our closest living relatives. Therefore, there are many similar physical characteristics that we share. Yet, even though there are a variety of similarities between us and chimpanzees, there are also many differences.

Similarities:

- Chimpanzees and humans look alike.
- They have hair, not fur, and can even get bald on their heads as they age.
- The facial structures of chimps and humans, especially the eyes, ears, and mouth, are also very similar in appearance.
- Chimpanzees are structured similarly to humans and can walk bipedally, meaning they can walk on two legs rather than        four, although they mostly walk on all four limbs.
- Chimpanzees and humans both have opposable thumbs that make them better at holding and using objects with their        hands. Think about how hard it would be to not have thumbs, it would be hard to tie your shoes or use a  pen.
- The internal anatomy is also almost the same between chimps and humans. The circulatory, respiratory, and digestive        systems of chimps and humans look almost the same and work in nearly identical ways.


Differences:

- Chimpanzees are shorter than we are.
- They have more hair, but lack the facial hair that adult male humans have.
- Chimpanzees have bigger eyes, noses and more pronounced eyebrows, which differs from human facial structure.
- Humans’ brains are bigger than chimps’ brains are, so humans have a larger head in proportion to their shoulders and     hips than chimpanzees do.
- Young chimps have a pale face that darkens, as they get older, eventually becoming black, which is a characteristic of an        older chimpanzee.
- Young chimps also have a white tuft of fur on their rumps. This fades and disappears when the chimp becomes an adult. 
- Chimpanzees also have good senses and big round ears to help them hear and wide nostrils to help them smell.
- Chimps have incisors, molars, and canines just like human teeth, but their canines are very large and sharp. This helps        them to eat a diverse diet that includes many fruits, plants, and even meat.

Chimpanzees are built to be efficient when moving around in, and using resources from the forests where they live. Chimpanzees spend 40-60% of each day climbing, resting, or eating in trees during the day. Chimps’ feet are different than ours, with less of an arch and opposable toes so that they can grip branches with their feet. The soles of their feet and palms have no hair and very thick skin that is good for grasping trees and walking on rough surfaces. Chimps have thicker and stronger arms and legs than humans do, and this makes them better at climbing trees. They have longer arms than humans do so they can swing and jump between trees. A chimp’s shoulders are also more flexible and stronger to support their weight when they climb. Chimps can also bend their strong fingers into a hook shape to help them when they swing on branches. Imagine if you could swing from one arm on the jungle gym while eating a sandwich, wouldn’t that be awesome?

Chimpanzees are only partially bipedal. That means that they only walk on two feet sometimes. Most of the time, they use their arms to help them walk. Humans are more adapted in structure for standing upright, and chimpanzees are more adapted for mostly walking on feet and arms or climbing in trees. The gluteus maximus of a chimpanzee is much smaller than that of a human because it is not needed to keep them upright at all times like humans.

Compared to a human, the skeletal structure of the chimpanzee is bent slightly forward at the waist so that their arms touch the ground when walking. They have arms that are longer than their legs and knuckles that are strong enough for using as support on the ground when they run. Their tough knuckles allow them to walk and run with their hands and feet on the ground. When chimps do this they can go faster and move more efficiently because their arms are longer than legs so this gives them more stability and agility.

Think about how you climb on slippery surfaces: it is easier to keep your balance if you use your arms to help. Females are between 2 and 3.5 feet tall and weigh 57-110 pounds. Males are bigger and much stronger, standing between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighing 90-115 pounds. Many of the differences between chimpanzees and humans are a result of the different habitats that they live in.</description>

		<categories>1.3. Sub - Species</categories>
		<description>Four subspecies have been identified, based on differences in appearance and distribution:

1. Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee

The Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee which inhabits the rainforest alongside the border of Nigeria and Cameroon, one of the types of chimpanzees. Male Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees can weigh as many as 70 kilos with a body size of as much as 1.2 meters and a height of 1.3 meters. Females are considerably smaller. The Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) inhabits the rainforests of Africa that cover elements of the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Male members of those chimpanzees develop as much as as a lot as 70 kilos and attain a body size of almost 1.2 meters and a height of 1.6 meters. The subspecies is probably the most threatened among the many different subspecies of the common chimpanzees primarily due to its slim range of distribution. The hostile human behavior in the direction of these animals must be altered if these animals are to outlive sooner or later.


2. Western chimpanzee

The western chimpanzee, or West African chimpanzee, (Pan troglodytes verus) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee. It inhabits western Africa, primarily in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone however with populations in surrounding countries. The western chimpanzee (P. t. verus) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), together with the central chimpanzee (P. t. troglodytes), the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (P. t. ellioti), and the eastern chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii).The western chimpanzee final shared a common ancestor with P. t. ellioti between 0.4 and 0.6 million years ago (mya) and with P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii 0.38–0.55 mya. The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), because the name suggests, lives in western Africa. The largest populations are concentrated within the countries of Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire.


3. Central chimpanzee

The central chimpanzee or tschego (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee (one of many closest dwelling kinfolk to people, together with the bonobo).It happens primarily in Gabon, Cameroon, and the Republic of the Congo, but additionally, to a lesser extent, in different areas, one of the types of chimpanzees. A subspecies of the common chimpanzee, the central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) lives in Africa the place it’s discovered within the Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and Gabon.Small populations additionally exist in Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and some different countries. The central chimpanzees are primarily discovered within the savanna woodlands, the tropical moist forests, and likewise the forest-savanna mosaics.The animals are discovered at altitudes ranging between sea level and about 9,800 feet. The IUCN classifies these chimpanzees as endangered. Only about 47,000 to 78,000 people of this species survive right now.


4. Eastern chimpanzee

The eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) is a subspecies of the common chimpanzee. It is native to the Central African Republic, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania. The eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) is one of many subspecies of the common chimpanzee that’s present in many countries of Africa together with Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, DRC, and CAR. The eastern chimpanzee has been extensively studied by Dr. Jane Goodall on the Gombe National Park. The chimpanzees are categorized as Endangered by the IUCN. Contagious human ailments have affected populations of chimpanzees within the past. The animals are each terrestrial and arboreal by nature and might stroll upright for short distances. The chimpanzees are omnivores that predate on each vegetation and animal. Leopards and lions predate on these animals.</description>

		<categories>1.4. Habitat</categories>
		<description>Just like us, chimpanzees require a diet of various types of foods. Their diet includes fruits, such as Saba Florida, nuts, leaves, and even meat!

Think about all of the different foods that you eat and where you get these foods. Well a chimp cannot go to a grocery store, which means their habitat, has to hold all of these foods, which means they should have a high biodiversity. A forest with high biodiversity is often a very healthy forest capable of supporting many forms of wildlife, including chimpanzees and the food they need. If the forest doesn’t have enough food, chimpanzees will move to where there is food.

Chimpanzees can benefit the forest as well. This type of relationship, where both parties benefit, is called a mutualistic relationship.

One example of this relationship involves the African Nutmeg plant. Chimps will eat the whole African Nutmeg to help them when they have an upset stomach. After they eat the nut, the nut will travel through their digestive system to strip off the fuzzy outer layer After the chimpanzee poops out the hard nut (ewww!) the nut can now grow into a seedling because the chimpanzee’s digestive system took off the outside of the seed.

Chimpanzees are only found on one continent in the world. They live in the dense jungle forest of Africa. Older forests tend to make the best habitats for them because more plant species have had time to grow and fill in the layers of the forest. This is important because chimpanzees rely on forests with many layers.

The layers of the forest begin with the ground layer, otherwise known as the forest floor, moving up is the understory, the canopy, and the emergent layer which pops up above the canopy layer at the very top. Chimpanzees use many of these layers, but can be found mostly on the ground layer or in the understory. Chimpanzees sometime use the canopy layer of the forest to look out for other chimps, predators, or to chase red colobus monkeys that they can eat. Chimps use all of the layers of the forest in many ways, for example, the young chimps will use the intertwining branches and vines like a large jungle gym while their mothers groom others and watch them. Think about when you play with other kids on a team or on the playground. You will be playing with the other kids while all of your mothers are talking to each other watching to make sure you don’t get into trouble, just like the chimpanzees!

The lower layers of the forest are used by the chimps to travel far distances. Here they can also find some low growing food. Chimps will spend about the same amount of time in each layer of the forest except at night where they will sleep in trees.

		<description>Consciousness

Many people often wonder: how much are chimps actually like us? One of the things that make humans unique is that we can recognize ourselves. Anyone who has watched a dog notice his reflection in a mirror can see that the dog is reacting to the image as if he was interacting with another dog, trying to play with the ‘new’ dog or scare off the ‘intruder’ by barking. This is called a social response, as if the animal was socializing with another animal like himself. For an animal, it is easy to assume that if they see an image it represents another individual because at first glance this is what it appears to be. They have a natural urge to categorize others as friends or foe, ultimately determining if they are in danger or not. Apes have a more complex reaction to their reflection.  Initially they too, react as if they are seeing another individual, but then they notice that they are in control of the image they see. Chimpanzees do something scientists call contingency testing – they make movements while watching themselves in the mirror.  It seems to be the way they figure out that it is themselves in the mirror and not other chimpanzees.  They then explore parts of their body that they wouldn’t normally be able to see without the aid of a mirror. They use the mirror to more carefully groom their backs, necks and face. Often they carefully clean their eyes and teeth, locations they would not be able to see needed attention without the use of a mirror. This behavior parallels the behaviors that humans can be seen doing in mirrors and emphasizes the remarkable similarity between the simple behaviors of humans and  chimpanzees. 


Decision making

Most animals do not seem to make conscious decisions.  Instead, they react by instinct, an inborn pattern of behavior that is triggered by a strong natural impulse. The average animal doesn’t waste time considering how he or she should react to a situation because taking those extra seconds could mean the difference between life and death. The gazelle that pauses to wonder whether or not he should run from a lion will be the one most likely to be caught and eaten. Any animal, including gazelles, spend most of their time foraging but always have to be on the watch for predators. 

The gazelle that will have the greatest chance at living the longest would be one that could detect and run from predators the quickest; complex decision making is not required and would even hinder this split second action. Chimpanzees are not like flighty gazelles. They seem to wait, observe their situation and surroundings, weigh the costs and benefits to their behavior, and then act based on what they have seen and considered.  In waiting and gathering information about their surroundings a chimp may be able to make a more informed decision about where to find food and how to access it.


Problem solving

Problem solving is a skill that is dependent on having a complex brain that can accommodate the absorption and synthesis of many different stimuli. As you learned earlier, a chimpanzee is known to observe and make decisions based on the situation.  This leads us to believe that a chimp can be a good problem solver. The act of solving problems opens a lot of new possible rewards for the animals that are capable of it.  In one instance, a chimpanzee in a laboratory setting was presented with a banana that was just out of reach. The chimp had two sticks available to it that were separately each too short to reach the banana, but that could be interlocked and used as a whole, longer stick to knock down the food.  The chimpanzee used what is called insight, knowing how an object can be applied to the task at hand without any former practice, and also demonstrated tool use.  Other animals could not comprehend the concept of using a stick to reach a banana because of the indirect thought that has to be applied in using the tool. A lemur would never use a stick to get food that was out of his or her reach because they make direct connections between seeing and eating their food. If they can’t reach it they won’t use tools (because they only manipulate objects when they try to eat them), and they may just give up.


Communication

There is no doubt that animals can communicate. They just don’t go about it in exactly the same way as humans.  Chimpanzees, as well as other animals, communicate vocally but non-verbally; that is they make noises that indicate their general mood, but they don’t use words to communicate exactly how they feel. For a chimpanzee, words are often unnecessary because they can make their intentions clear without using words. For instance, to get help from a group member, a chimpanzee with a thorn in her skin merely has to present the troublesome area to another chimp. The second chimp obligingly grooms the first to try to alleviate any problems he or she may find.  more on communication


Evolution of Intelligence

If we take a look at the evolutionary history of primates, it can be seen that as monkeys and apes get more closely related to humans there is a trend towards having more complex cognition, or thought processes. A lemur is the simplest kind of primate and is most distantly related to humans. Lemurs will investigate objects with their mouth and hands, and do so only as they would if they were foraging. They explore their world with the same pattern of behavior they use to look for food.  Every animal forages for food, so the lemur’s behavior is not much different from  non-primates’ behaviors.  After lemurs, on the evolutionary tree, come monkeys. They readily manipulate objects, but don’t pay attention to the effects they produce.  For instance a snow monkey will thoroughly investigate an object, turning it over and pulling it apart much more than a lemur would, but if they shake something that rattles, the monkey will not try to repeat the action to make the noise again.  The monkey is only concerned at finding the food available to him or her, not in the interesting effects he or she produces when manipulating objects. Great apes come next on the evolutionary tree. They are the closest evolutionary relatives to humans.  All four species of great apes: orangutan, gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee, manipulate and investigate objects that aren’t related to foraging. This already shows a distinction between apes and primates that are less closely related to humans. Nest building requires the manipulation of materials that isn’t driven by the need to get food. It has been found that chimpanzees do the same behaviors, just like young human child would: exploring surroundings and repeating interesting effects, like unexpected results or strange noises, made through the manipulation of objects.

		<description>
Chimpanzees are our closest nonhuman relatives in the animal kingdom, so it is no surprise that a chimpanzee’s lifespan is similar to humans. In everyone’s lifespan there are various stages in our lives that define us and by using these stages we can see how similar we are to the chimpanzee. Obviously, every event that happens in a chimpanzee’s life does not occur in our own life, and there are lots of things that happen in our life that don’t happen in a chimpanzee’s life. However, this highlights how some important aspects of chimpanzees’ lives relate to our lives. 

Starting at the beginning of any animal’s lifespan. Female chimpanzees’ pregnancies can last about 230 days, whereas in humans we have a longer pregnancy that lasts us about 280 days! When a chimpanzee is born they are helpless, with little to no grasping abilities, so parental care mostly from the mother is crucial at this point in time. Humans are the same in this instance since babies are also born helpless and we depend on our mother for care. However, a baby chimpanzee is born with a cute pink face and white hair tuft on their backside that disappears with age. The baby chimp also does not have a full coat of fur; rather their fur grows in and thickens into maturity. Think about how similar this actually is to humans, although we may not be born with a white tuft of fur or a pink face, we are born with baby features. Sometimes human baby’s hair and eye color changes as they age and we gain more hair as we age.

The baby chimpanzee is then carried by the mother on her front side for 3 to 6 months and as the baby grows they begin to ride around on their mother’s back. Even we humans are carried around when we are babies until we are stable enough to walk on our own. You have probably seen a mother holding her baby while waiting in line or maybe you have seen her hold her baby in a holder that rests on her back or in the front of her. Around the age of 2 years the baby chimp will start to venture from their mother and explore independently, yet they still will not move beyond an area of around 16 feet from her. At around age 3 they will expand their exploratory area and move farther and farther away from their mother. When we were babies, we did not stay with our mother as closely as chimpanzee babies do.  From the moment we are born there are times that we are 16 feet or farther away from our mother. 

Chimpanzees are weaned when they are between 3.5 and 4.5 years old.  Weaning is when the mother no longer provides her milk to the young animal, and they begin to eat the same food that the older animals do. The age of weaning in humans depends on where we live, our culture, and our mother’s choice. At ages 4 to 5 chimpanzees begin sleeping on their own, making their own nests. We normally sleep in our own crib or bed close to mom from the time we are born.

During the juvenile period, from about six to nine years old, chimpanzees remain close to their mother but play independently and have greater social interactions with other community members. Think about how your life changed during these years and how much you grew up!  We have social ties and interactions with other individuals throughout our infancy.  We communicate and play with others. Typically at around 4 years old, we will go to school but are still kept under the supervision of adults.

In adulthood, chimpanzee males can have their first child around 15 years old, but females since they mature sooner can have their first child between 13 and 14 years old. They can even have a child every 3 to 5 years! In humans, depending on the culture a person was raised in, can have a child this young but typically they do not until later in life. Also in humans the time between a human having one baby and the next baby varies tremendously depending on the parent’s preferences. As a chimpanzee ages, both females and males, begin getting grey hair at the top of the head and can even begin to bald. This is true for humans as well, but balding is much more common in males.

This now brings us to the end of the lifespan. In chimpanzees both males and females have been seen to reproduce until death. In humans due to our given average life expectancy, neither males nor females usually have children until death, although males technically can father a child when they are very old. Chimpanzee’s average wild life expectancy is 45 years old. Our average life expectancy can depend on a lot of different factors. Generally, it is between 60 and 70 years old.</description>

		<categories>2. CHIMPS AS SOCIAL ANIMALS</categories>
		<description>Chimpanzee communities can consist of about 20-100 chimps whereas human communities can be found in the millions, but each human and chimpanzee community may have smaller groups. Chimpanzee groups live in selected territories, similar to humans who live in different communities in different countries. Think about it like this: if you live in New York State, you could say you live in the group called New York but you are part of the larger community and territory of the United States. However, chimpanzee’s territories are much smaller than ours; only consisting of 30-150 square miles. That is as big as 50-250 football fields! Territories consist of two different areas: the border and the core.  A border or peripheral area of a territory is the outside area of the community. The core area of a territory  is in the middle of the territory and is the most heavily used portion of the territory.

The main factors which affect a chimpanzee’s territory size are food availability and intercommunity relations. Chimpanzees are a very social species within their communities. It is important for communities to have strong social bonds with each other to ensure their welfare. However, such hospitality does not usually extend to neighboring communities. Chimpanzees are very territorial and protective. Males and sometimes females and juveniles go on 'patrols' to ensure other chimpanzees do not enter their territory. These patrols are usually a single line of chimpanzees that walk along their territory’s border. These patrols are similar to a  community watch in humans, where people keep an eye out for each other to make sure there are no intruders that can harm them walking around their neighborhood.

 There are some differences between human societies and chimp societies. When human communities are threatened we call the cops; chimpanzees on the other hand will attack the intruder if the situation calls for such action. If the patrollers are too few in number they will retreat back to their core territory, but if they outnumber the intruders a fight usually is started. The fight ends when the intruders leave. If the intruders don’t leave then a war may be started between two communities. When a community wins a war they receive similar rewards that early humans received when they went to war. The victors gain land and territory, new food sources, and other resources. The victors also get improved security and strength by adding numbers to their group.  The addition of more females leads to more chimpanzees in the community and more genetic diversity. Besides all of these benefits new research shows that when there is more territory, females become bigger and have a more births, thus increasing population by decreasing the time it takes to produce offspring.</description>

		<categories>2.1. Mothering</categories>
		<description>The bond between a mother chimpanzee and her infant is like the one we as humans share with our mothers. Like chimpanzee infants we rely on our mothers for support, protection, and education. 

Most, if not all, of an infant’s care rests solely with the mother. It is the mother who nurses, grooms, carries, and protects the infant from danger that can occur both in and out of the group. This investment from the mother allows the infant to receive support and care throughout its life along with knowledge and skills that help it to survive. This substantial amount of care lasts through infancy, adolescence, and even into adulthood. Can you think of another species that has this much maternal care? It’s US! Most human children stay with their mothers until they are in their late teens or early twenties, some even stay longer!

Female chimpanzees may leave their natal group or they may stay with their mothers into adulthood. Staying by their mother’s side until they become mature allows them to watch their mother take care of younger siblings and gain knowledge and skills that they will use when they become mothers themselves. Male offspring may leave their mothers at an earlier period in their lives than a female would but males will often return to their mothers for emotional support. For example, males must establish themselves in the group’s hierarchy. This is a stressful time in a chimpanzee’s life and a male may go back to its mother when things don’t go his way. Often times in human culture we call men that continually seek their mother for support “momma’s boys”.

The bond between mother and infant is often so strong, that when a mother loses an infant she will mourn. Mourning behaviors can include carrying around the body of the infant for several days after it has died, continuously touching the infant to assure herself the infant is dead, and looking to other adult chimpanzees to get their  reassurance on the matter. The mother-infant bond is one of the most important in chimpanzee life. We humans also have strong bonds and mothers will also mourn the loss of their children, or anyone in their family for that matter.

Chimpanzee mothers will begin to teach their young life skills at a very young age. An infant chimpanzee will learn from its mother a wide variety of skills and acquire a large knowledge base. Choosing the right food and how to obtain that food is often a major part of what they learn. A young chimpanzee, once it is weaned, must make decisions on which fruits and plants it will eat.  There are many plants that can make a chimpanzee very ill and they must learn which of these plants to avoid. A mother chimpanzee teaches her offspring which plants they can and cannot eat. Young chimpanzees learn this by observing what their mother eats and then mimicking her actions.

A young chimpanzee will also learn what plants are used for medical purposes by watching what plants its mother eats when she is sick. I bet your mother has taught you many things so that you can survive on your own. How many times have you heard, “Don’t do that it’s dangerous/stay away from it you could get hurt” or “It’s okay to eat this, it’s good for you, but that is bad so you shouldn’t eat it?” Your mother is trying to protect you and give you a knowledge base that will be useful later in life. This is similar to chimpanzee mothers who teach their own children how to survive in the wild when it is time to leave the natal group and go off on their own.

Another skill that a mother teaches her offspring is how to make and use tools. Again, a young chimpanzee will watch its mother and mimic her actions with the tools until it has perfected the skills of making and using tools itself. By watching its mother, the young chimpanzee has just learned a valuable skill that will be useful throughout the rest of its life, because tools are often a way for chimpanzees to acquire food.  

A mother will also teach her offspring how to act in social situations. Watching their mothers interact with other chimpanzees in the group will allow the chimpanzee to gain knowledge on how it should act in the group as well. This is important to know because chimpanzees rely on others in the group for safety and support. If a chimpanzee doesn’t know how to live cohesively in a group then it may lose it support system, which could lead to a decrease in survival. Just as chimpanzee mothers teach their infants how to act in social situations, so do our human mothers. It isn’t hard to think of times when your mother has scolded you for acting impolite in public, or has asked you to say please or thank you when someone does something for you.  All these things make us incredibly similar to chimpanzees.

Does this remind you of your family? Our mothers not only get help from their older offspring but from their own siblings and mother as well.  We have aunts and grandmothers that help our mother take care of us when our mother is busy. This intense family support is not only found in humans but it can also be found in Chimpanzees!

The sibling relationship is also similar in both humans and chimpanzees. For many of us our siblings are our go to playmate and friend.  We rely on our siblings, although we sometimes don’t like to admit it, for both emotional and physical support, knowledge, advice, and care. If you have siblings, how many times have you helped your parents with your younger sibling? Or have had your older sibling take care of you? Chimpanzees want the same things from their siblings, adding another similarity to the already growing list of traits we share with them.</description>

		<categories>2.2. Inside a chimp community</categories>
		<description>
Chimpanzees and humans are both very social species. We both surround ourselves with family members and close companions, even individuals we don’t get along with. Although we are similar, the structure of the social interaction of humans and chimpanzees can vary quite significantly.

Chimpanzees have a complex social structure called a fission-fusion society. An example of a fission-fusion society you can think of a group of college students residing at a campus. During the day, groups of students have different classes, and may hang out together, scattered on the campus grounds. At night, all of the college residents come back to the dorms to sleep. This is like chimpanzees in that, chimpanzees live in a large community with different subgroups that break apart during the day but come together in a central location at night to sleep. They will disperse themselves in these smaller groups to find food throughout their forest territory. These subgroups will then congregate in their large community and sleep near each other, up in the trees, at night. The subgroups will switch constantly, with different chimps spending time together day to day.  As humans, we do this too. On different days, we may spend time with different groups of friends or family members.

A chimpanzee community consists of adult males and females with adolescents offspring. The size of the subgroups can change depending on the chimpanzees’ activity.  For example, a hunting party will have a large number of chimpanzees because it is easier to catch prey with more hunters. Foraging parties also have a large number of individuals when food is plentiful. While traveling from one food source to another, chimpanzees may be in small groups or alone because individuals  travel at different speeds. Even in our lives, the number of individuals we spend time with varies with our day to day activities.

Male chimpanzees often spend their entire life in the community they were born in, whereas female chimpanzees may travel to different communities. Males tend to be more social than females and prefer each other’s company but females tend to be less social and spend most of their time with their young. Females tend to find food alone instead of in groups because of food competition. Females need to spend their time taking care of their young and cannot waste energy fighting over food. Male chimpanzees are able to fight over food because they do not take care of the young.

Chimpanzee society is dominated by male strength. The adult males of a community will fight for the top ranking position called an alpha male. Usually the alpha male is the strongest chimpanzee in the community but this is not always the case.

Some male chimpanzees are not strong enough to overtake the position as alpha male by physically fighting, so they overtake the position with their smarts. A male chimpanzee can gain support from the other chimpanzees in the community. If enough chimpanzees favor one male over the alpha male, then the community can help the favored male take the position as alpha male. When a male is in the alpha position, he often displays his strength. When his hair sticks straight up we call this  piloerection he does this to make himself look bigger and he runs around making loud shrieking vocalizations. He may break branches off  trees and throw rocks to intimidate the other chimpanzees and help him keep the power he has within the group. Could you imagine throwing a temper tantrum every time you wanted to get everyone to respect you? It would get pretty tiring after a while. Chimpanzees lower in rank than the alpha male will offer their hand while grunting to the alpha male as a sign of submission. The position of alpha male is never permanent and often changes from male to male.

Female chimpanzees also have a dominance hierarchy in the group in order to gain first access to food and other resources. Their status is not as extreme as the males. A dominant female’s offspring will inherit the status  of her mother. Have you ever met someone who was born into a wealthy or highly respected family? Well, that gain of status can be paralleled to this phenomenon in chimpanzees.

The male has to be accepted by the females before he can gain his status. Females can be very choosy and if the females do not like approve of the alpha male they will not let him mate with them. Females provide all the care for their offspring and they do not want a male as their leader unless he is the one they feel can best provide for the group. Females can choose to support another male they see being a better leader for the group. So it’s important for males to have good relationships with the females of the troupe.

Chimpanzees are very territorial. Different communities live in different parts of the rainforest. When a chimpanzee community is on the boundary of their territory conflicts can arise between chimpanzee communities. Mother chimpanzees with babies have to be cautious on the territory edges because often babies will be killed by other chimpanzees from neighboring communities. Aggression usually doesn’t occur within the community unless it has to do with fighting for the alpha male position or fighting over females.

A female chimpanzee becomes more social when she is ready to mate. Usually when a female is ready to mate when there is food readily available. This benefits the female because the female needs more food to support her baby chimp. The female has 10-12 days available to mate and become pregnant. During these days male chimpanzees may fight over the female. Usually, the alpha male gets the opportunity to mate with the female. A male chimpanzee will shake a branch to invites the female to mate with him. When a female is ready to mate, a male may guard her so no other male can mate with her. After the female is pregnant, the male has nothing to do with the baby or mother. We humans, unlike chimpanzees are monogamous and usually both the male and female will contribute to raising the child.</description>

		<categories>2.3. Play</categories>
		<description>As children and even adults, we humans love to play. Chimpanzees, being our closest relatives, are no different! Chimps use play to develop skills that will be required when they are older. The skills chimps obtain are not just social necessities, which aid in their interactions between other members of their group, they also develop life skills which help young chimpanzees to feed and defend themselves as adults. The similarity between ourselves and chimps in how we play is truly quite amazing!

Although adult chimps love to play, the majority of play behavior occurs in younger chimpanzees. When adults do play it is often with younger members of their group.  We do the same thing, especially with younger siblings who need our attention! Young chimpanzees love to rough house and wrestle with one another. Much like children love to play tag, young chimps also chase each other often resulting in some playful wrestling and rolling around on the ground. Chimps are excellent climbers and will chase each other up into the trees. This climbing is good practice for when they need to climb quickly into a tree to avoid a predator or another chimpanzee.

So when we play, what is something that we all usually do? We usually laugh if we are having a good time, right? Well, chimpanzees are no different! While chimps of all ages play, wrestle, and tickle each other, they make a sound called a “play-pant.” It is amusing to hear chimps play-panting because even if you had never heard it before, you would immediately recognize the sound as laughing. Even the expression on the face of the chimpanzee looks as though they are laughing and having a good time! Occasionally play can become too rough. This usually happens when young chimps are playing with older juveniles. If the youngster has had enough they call out as if they are screaming. Most likely mom won’t be too far away and comes running to the aid of her baby. She will then scoop up her baby and carry them away from the rough housing juvenile. We also see this in humans. Have you ever cried while playing with someone else because they were being unfair or they stole your toy? Most likely your mom came to settle the dispute.

Becoming an adult human or chimpanzee usually takes practice. Play as babies and adolescents (or teenagers) helps both of us develop skills that we will need to use when we reach adulthood. So really, play is like practice for when we are older!  Chimps play for practice all the time. Often times they will play with tools and practice using them, trying to act just like mom.  An example of this would be how they practice their termite fishing behavior. Even very young babies have been seen trying to poke into a termite mound with a stick, imitating what they see mom doing. With enough practice they will get it right eventually!  Babies also like to practice building nests up in trees. They have been witnessed bending branches back like mom, just not in quite the same organized fashion as her because that takes a little bit of practice too. 

Although wrestling and playing chase looks like just a fun game, it is actually good practice for when chimps become older. Due to their structured social organization of dominance and submissive adults, it is a good idea to be able to fight or run when they get older. These skills also help them when hunting because of the intense running and climbing they do in order to catch their prey.  If they do not become the dominant adult in the group when they are older they also need these climbing and running skills to avoid more dominant individuals of the group that may not be nice to them. It’s all part of being a chimp!

		<categories>2.4. Communication</categories>
		<description>There is no doubt that, like humans, animals can communicate. However, they don’t go about it in exactly the same way as humans. Chimpanzees, as well as other animals, communicate vocally but non-verbally, meaning they make noises that indicate their general mood, but they don’t use words to communicate exactly how they feel. For a chimpanzee words are often unnecessary; they can make their intentions clear without them.

Smile:  Chimpanzees show their teeth in an expression that looks like a smile when nervous. Have you ever found yourself smiling a big toothy smile when nervous? 

Closed mouth grin:  This expression is used to show submission.   Perhaps you have made or have seen someone else make this face when showing another individual that everything is alright and they won’t start any trouble.

Relaxed Open Mouth display:  Can you remember making this face the last time that you laughed at a funny joke? This is used to show non aggression and is often used as a play face along with rhythmic breathing much like the expression made during human laughter.

Pout face:  Does this face remind you of a face you or someone you know were upset begging for something? This face is made by chimpanzees after a threat, when begging for something, and when searching for their mothers.
It is amazing how gestures as small as changes in mouth position can give messages to others in both chimpanzee and human societies!


Vocal communication

Chimpanzees and humans make vocalizations in situations to give another individual a message or express an emotion. Not all vocal communication has to be performed with words. Think of a time when someone is laughing or crying, people nearby know exactly what the individual is feeling without a single word being spoken between them. We know that laughter is normally associated with happiness and feelings of joy and that crying and whimpering is normally associated with feelings of sadness.  This is the same as in chimpanzees! A chimpanzee will whimper or cry when they are feeling distressed and laugh when they feel excitement.  When young chimpanzees play they will emit a breathy laughter, just like you do when you play with your friends or family. Chimpanzees can recognize each other’s voices just like you can recognize your friend’s voice on the telephone.  Each chimpanzee makes a unique pant hoot that is used to recognize the individual, much like how humans have different voices. A chimpanzee can pant hoot from across the forest and a human can talk over the phone or from behind a door and the individual, chimpanzee and human, can be recognized by their sound alone. Chimpanzees use over 30 vocalizations in different situations. Look at the list below containing many more vocalizations and imagine what sounds you would make in those situations. You can see how similar some of the sounds are to what you would do in the same situation!


Non-Vocal Communications

There are many messages and emotions shared with facial expressions and simple body language in both chimpanzees and humans. There are gestures that are used in non-vocal communication in which contact is made between individuals’ bodies and there are gestures where no physical contact is made at all. 

Chimpanzees will hold hands, kiss, pat each other’s backs, and groom with friendly touches. All of these chimp gestures are seen in humans and also have the same meaning that humans give them!  It is easy to see with holding hands and kissing in humans, but what about patting backs and grooming? Often, we will pat the back of another to give them reassurance. Think of a sporting event where a coach pats the back of an athlete who has improved or done well, have you ever been in a situation where your coach pats you on the back because you have done something right during a game or practice? Did it leave you feeling good about yourself even though there were no words exchanged between the two of you? Gestures have a way of conveying a variety of feelings without having to communicate verbally.

 We will also hug or shake hands for reassurance after a figure of authority upsets us. And, what about grooming? Chimpanzees groom each other by moving another individual’s hair around and removing dead pieces of skin, insects, or other particles that may fall into their hair. Many times young girls will play with each other’s hair, putting it into different styles. Human adults groom each other as well; we are always going into the hair salon or barber shop to get our hair cut and groomed.This is a friendly contact between individuals just as is seen between chimpanzees. We have all been on a situation in which a gesture, without any verbal communication, can mean a thousand words. Look at the pictures below to see just how similar the touches between chimpanzees are to touches between humans.

The similarity in gestures between us humans and chimpanzees can also be seen in such gestures that do not involve bodily contact between individuals. In chimpanzees, when a lower ranking or subordinate individual (one who doesn’t have much authority in the group) approaches a more dominant individual the chimp is crouched down, presents its rump, or holds out its hand.  Humans do some of these gestures as well. Watch a human as he or she approaches and individual of much greater authority; they will sometimes hunch their shoulders and push their head down and look up the other individual if they feel that they are below the other in status. This human behavior may be difficult to spot without close observation, however, the gesture of holding out a hand when approaching is very easy to see. Holding out a hand is a gesture that we humans commonly use when first meeting an individual or when greeting an individual of higher rank than ourselves in our workplace. More often than not, this gesture becomes a touch when the higher ranked individual shakes the hand that has been offered. As discussed above, this handshake can be viewed as a sign of reassurance.

		<categories>2.5. Grooming</categories>
		<description>Grooming, the act of tidying, cleaning, or brushing oneself or another, occurs  in both chimpanzees and humans. In fact, grooming is seen in all primates, though it is performed differently within each species. Chimpanzees grooming involves removing pieces of dirt, plants, dried skin, and insects from the hair of another chimpanzee of off of themselves. Our own human grooming may involve showering pedicure, cleaning your ears, or maybe even an exfoliating massage.

Even though there are differences in the way we groom they stillachieve the same purpose of cleanliness as well as relaxation and even bonding. Think of time when you picked a piece of fuzz or other small particle from your own or someone else's clothes or hair or how relaxing it is to have someone rub your back. This is just like what chimpanzees do! 

The most obvious purpose of grooming in the chimpanzee is the removal of unwanted debris from their coats. But, during times of relaxation, a chimpanzee may often be found grooming another chimpanzee or its own hair. When we want to relax, we often take a bath or get a massage. Just think, grooming is associated with relaxation in chimpanzees and in us! Normally, the chimpanzee uses one hand to hold the hair back while the other hand, lips, or teeth are used to pick out and remove the unwanted small pieces. Grooming is a very important social interaction for chimpanzees and is used to maintain friendly ties among family and community members. A chimpanzee may request to be groomed by approaching another chimpanzee and presenting a part of his or her body for grooming.  A grooming session may include several individuals of different ages and genders, and can last for a few seconds, minutes, or even hours! Both chimpanzee and human mothers groom their infants.

In chimpanzees, this is sometimes done to reduce the stress of infants during weaning (the process of gradually changing the infant’s diet from the mother’s milk to an adult diet). Can you remember a time when you were young and something made you stressed or upset?  It is possible that your mom may have calmed you down through physical contact by rubbing your back or wiping your tears away. Chimpanzees use grooming to reassure each other as well.  Grooming is used to relax tension from threats and aggression in chimpanzees and may be used as a way to make up after a conflict and strengthen the relationship for the future.

Social grooming in chimpanzees can serve other functions as well. For example, a chimpanzee who had previously been groomed by another chimpanzee will be more likely to repay that favor in the future, either by grooming or sharing food. This means that in chimpanzees and in humans, if we do something nice for another, that individual is likely to do something nice for us. This is called reciprocal altruism.  

For humans and chimpanzees, both males and females are involved in grooming. However, grooming plays a special role in the lives of chimpanzee males and their dominance hierarchy.  Studies show that large males rely more on physical attacks than other techniques to dominate other chimpanzees. Small males rely on grooming other male and female chimpanzees to gain their support and remain in good standing within the community. This helps the less dominant males form alliances to guard against larger males. As a result of these behaviors, smaller males tend to groom more often than larger males that do not need support from others.

		<categories>2.6. Tool Use</categories>
		<description>Tool use was once a defining characteristic that was only attributed to humans. However, when Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also use tools, we learned that we were no longer special in our tool using capabilities. Chimps all over Africa have been seen using a wide variety of tools for many different tasks. Think about some of the tools you use every day.  Are there tools we as humans use that are similar to those used by chimpanzees? Together we’ll discover some of the really creative ways chimpanzees use the objects around them to create tools.

Most of the tools that chimps make and use are actually geared towards eating. Just as human cultures use different utensils for food, so do different groups of chimps. Think about the utensils we humans use to eat our food. In Asian countries it is usual for chopsticks to be used, while in America forks and knives are common utensils. What do you eat with at your house? We and chimpanzees are both very similar in the ways we use and create tools for our benefit. Jane Goodall first discovered chimpanzees using tools to capture termites, which were buried underground in sealed mounds of dirt called termite mounds. She noticed that they would use two different sticks as tools to acquire the protein rich insects.

The first thing chimps do is use a heavy stick to chisel a hole into the termite mound to find an opening. The second tool they use is much more refined than their chisel. The second stick is known as a fishing tool and it is very special because they actually modify it before using it. The chimpanzees find a straight stick or long blade of grass and pull all of the leaves off of it, so that they can easily fit the stick into the hole of the termite mound. Chimps are much better at termite fishing than we are. Jane Goodall herself tried her hand at termite fishing and couldn’t get nearly as many termites on the stick as the chimps she was watching did. Tool modification is extremely rare in the animal world which is yet another example of how chimps and humans are so similar.

In another group of chimps, different from the culture that Jane Goodall studied, there was a discovery of a hammer and anvil tool (top of page) being used to crack open hard nut shells. (An anvil is a hard surface that is used to place something on while it is hit with a hammer to crack it.) This is a perfect example of yet another similarity between chimps and us humans. What do you use to crack open nuts? We have all sorts of tools for nut cracking and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Chimps use different sized rocks as hammers to crush a hard nut on top of a larger rock, which is the anvil. 

Chimpanzees also use different tools in different areas to drink water from holes in trees. This water is often too deep for them to reach with their mouths so they must find other ways to access it. In some places chimps chew up leaves and spit them out to make an absorbent sponge which they then use to suck up the water. When they take it out of the tree it is full of water that can be easily sucked off of the sponge. Other chimps use tools like a straw to drink water from these holes. Chimpanzees are very creative when it comes to making tools for all sorts of jobs.</description>

		<categories>2.7. Food Culture</categories>
		<description>Food As a Cultural Aspect of Chimpanzee Life. Like with us humans, a chimpanzee’s diet varies depending on where they live. Think about it; people in India tend to eat spicier food than people who live in North America. Chimpanzees are similar to us because their diet changes based on where they live. Although, a chimp’s diet is not  only based on where they  live but also on the culture to which they belong.

For example, Many chimpanzees that live in the Western parts of Africa use rocks  to break open nuts, but chimpanzees in Eastern Africa do not practice such a skill. Young chimpanzees learn to collect food by watching and imitating their mothers’ behaviors. Each generation learns from older individuals which leads to a difference in collection techniques between regions.  Like the chimpanzees found in Gombe as well as the Mahale K group, one of the two groups found in Mahale, have been seen fishing for termites with twigs! But, the Tai and Gombe chimpanzees also fish for and eat driver ants, which  the Mahale groups usually avoid.

Another interesting thing about chimpanzee diets is that some populations use different tools or techniques based on the area in which they live in. For example, chimpanzees in Gombe climb a palm tree in order to obtain a food item known as a palm nut. While others found in the Tai forest and Bossou, the Western part of Africa, use a rock as a hammer and another as an anvil to open coula nuts.

Chimpanzees eat meat like many humans, and depending on where they live--Western or Eastern Africa--they will hunt differently. The chimpanzees found in the Tai forest hunt adult Red Colobus monkeys, where as the chimpanzee in Gombe or Mahale will hunt juveniles (the younger monkeys). The chimpanzees in Western Africa will also hunt together and share the meat more often than their cousins in Eastern Africa. In addition, only the Tai forest chimpanzees have been seen to eat the bone marrow (the inside of the bones of their prey) from their kills.

There are many reasons why these differences can be seen; one being the Chimpanzees habitat. In the Ivory Coast, there is a well-developed canopy to the forest, and monkeys may escape chimp predators by climbing high into the trees. In this kind of situation only cooperative hunting would be successful. However, in Gombe and Mahale the forests are not as dense. Not only would habitat be cause for a difference, but also the behavior of the prey would require different hunting tactics. In the dense forests the monkeys can  escape more easily, but in Gombe or Mahale the monkeys take a stand and fight approach and so adults are more aggressive than juveniles.

Another way chimpanzees are similar to us is that they will use certain plants for medicinal purposes! Chimpanzees will eat a long vine which has purple flowers called Aspilia in order to cure worms, parasites, and abdominal pain. Think about it; you have probably used plants for medical reasons. A common one is Aloe Vera, which is used to help soothe burns. What is interesting is that humans living in the same area will often use the same plants to treat anything from stomach problems to parasitic infections! Most of the time chimpanzees will also avoid eating these medical plants as part of their daily diet and  eat them only when they are feeling ill. Like how we would not take Tylenol unless we have a headache. Animals tend to avoid medicinal plants unless they need them as well.

While, there are plants with medical purposes found in different locations; there are a few chimpanzee groups that have access to different kinds of medical remedies outside of their native location. The chimpanzees found in Uganda eat the dirt in order to self-medicate themselves against malaria, an infectious disease passed by mosquitoes. However, the dirt alone is not enough; the chimps also consume the plant Trichilia Rubescens, which contains the malaria medicine, that mixes with the dirt and effectively protects them against malaria. But, this particular plant is only found in Western Africa, so Gombe and Mahale chimpanzees do not use this plant as medicine.</description>

		<categories>3. CONSERVATION</categories>
		<description>Some people would argue that we should conserve chimpanzees because…

- They are genetically similar, evolution.
- They have meaningful relationships with others, family.
- They are sentient,  intelligent beings.

But the simple fact of the matter is: We should respect all beings because all life has intrinsic value.


THE GOLDEN RULE

The best rule of thumb is the Golden Rule- treat others as you would want to be treated.  We use this rule when we deal with other people, but it should work for interactions with non-human animals too.
We can’t make you feel the need to help animals; everyone must make their own choices when it comes to how we treat them. You must take what you know, what you have learned from this web site, and your own gut instinct into account when making those decisions.


Things you can do to help:

- Choose not to go to places that use chimps.
- Don’t buy products with images of chimps on them.  They may look amusing, but it’s no joke to the chimpanzees.
- Use what you’ve learned to help spread awareness about what a great animal the chimp is, and how they need our help.</description>

		<categories>3.1. Chimpanzee Isolation</categories>
		<description>Chimpanzee Isolation

Humans and Chimpanzees naturally move and roam about large areas of land. We humans do not simply sit in our house all day long; we move around. We can go outside or go to a friend’s house and even travel to other cities, states, and countries. Chimpanzees naturally move around their habitats as well. They cover long distances in the rainforests of Africa where they live.  When moving about, chimpanzees will spend time in both the trees and on the ground with a large portion of travel being spent on the ground. A main difference between our ability to move around to new land areas and chimps’ abilities to move around their habitat is that chimps can run into huge obstacles; ones that are created by the roads and other elements of human civilization that we humans insert into the land. 

Think about how we often move from one area to another. We can use roads, sidewalks, and other types of paths to get about. The creation of roads for human use in Africa has led to deforestation in many areas. This deforestation, due to a rise in the human population, has taken a toll on the chimpanzee population. Originally there had been 25 countries that contained chimpanzees; unfortunately only 21 of these countries still have chimpanzees. Areas of rainforest that chimps use to move from one location to the next or compose the land area used by chimps to travel have disappeared and are continually disappearing, causing a great impact on the chimpanzee population. The deforestation is not only due to the creation of roads, but is also due to the general increase in the human population in regions of Africa. As the human population  in Africa increases  there is a demand for more land for homes, farms, and industry such as logging. Logging not only physically removes the trees from land chimpanzees use but we once again find roads created for large trucks to carry out the trees disrupting the habitats that chimpanzees utilize. 

With such deforestation chimpanzees have been separated from sections of land of which they once were free to make use and are now in isolated “pockets”. To get a clearer picture of these “pockets” imagine yourself on a small island surrounded by water where the only way to the next island is by a connecting strip of land. Now imagine that a bulldozer comes through and removes the land that connected the two islands. You are now stuck on the island with no way of leaving. This is exactly what is happening with the chimps’ forests. They are being caught on islands of forest because we are surrounding them with “water” such as roads and farm land.

Although the chimps are being caught on these islands, there are ways that can help them once again move from one area of land to the next. For example, imagine yourself back on your small island that is fully surrounded by water. Now imagine there is a bridge that has been built between the two islands. Even though the bridge is not the original connection between the two areas of land it looks similar to the original land strip as well as serves the original purpose. It allows you to move freely between the two islands. In Africa, trees can be planted between two isolated pockets of chimpanzees to create a “bridge” of habitat known as a corridor which allows free movement  between areas of habitat. The corridors may not be the original lands that once connected the vast habitat of chimpanzees, but they provide passage ways between areas of habitat that, without, would be separated from chimpanzees forever. Corridors provide hope that there is something that can be done to help chimpanzees from being lost from our world due to isolation!</description>

		<categories>3.2. Human Disease</categories>
		<description>It is amazing and exciting to see how closely related we are to chimpanzees; however, many chimpanzees face the threat of human disease due to this striking similarity. A chimpanzee can catch most of our human diseases because their bodies are very similar to ours. A disease that is not a big problem to you or to other humans, such as the common cold, can be devastating for a chimpanzee. Can you remember a time that you had a cough or perhaps the sniffles from a cold?  You probably did not feel the best for a few days but your body could fight off the cold since the illness is common and your body is prepared and knows how to fight off the sniffles.

Many human diseases have never before been experienced by chimps and are often introduced  to an area where chimps live.  Many people who go to visit and observe the chimps in the forest may be carrying germs that their bodies can fight off but that could make chimps sick and we may transmit our human germs to chimps. The chimpanzees’ immune systems have not built up a defense against the unfamiliar germs, and the chimps’ bodies are less able to fight off the diseases.  Whereas your body can quickly fight off the cough and sniffles of the common cold; some common human diseases can be life threatening for chimpanzees.

Chimpanzees pick up germs just like we humans do: usually from the air or from touching infected objects, and some simple steps can be easily taken to reduce the transmission of human diseases to chimps. If you go into the forests to see the chimps there will be rules about what is allowed and what is not allowed, in order to protect the chimpanzees.  It is important to follow these rules to prevent spreading diseases. People who feel sick, even if they just have a cold, should not go into the forest until they are better. When in the forest, everyone should maintain a distance of 10 feet from the chimps possible, and all precautions should be taken to avoid touching the chimps. People need to be very careful not to drop anything in the forest. Garbage and other human objects can spread germs to chimps who may come across these objects and pick them up later. Eating or drinking in the presence of the chimps is not allowed for a similar reason.  Also, remember if mother nature calls when you are in the forests, all human waste should also be buried at least one foot underground.

Many locations where humans including visitors, researchers, park rangers, and anyone else who may go within a relatively close distance of chimps require surgical masks to be worn when in the presence of the chimps. It has been discovered  that disease transmission from humans to chimps is reduced using this method.  Other places, though,  do not require masks to be worn because those who manage the area think that the masks are unnecessary and do not reduce the ability for human germs to be transmitted to chimps in the forest.  In both situations, regardless of the view on the effectiveness and use of surgical masks, visitors are told to maintain the 10 ft distance from the chimps, to reduce the likelihood  that any germs  breathed out by humans will reach the chimps.


These are all easy things that when practiced greatly reduce the incidence of disease transmission to chimpanzees. By thinking about and paying attention to our actions when we are near chimps, humans can prevent the spread of many germs that cause health problems for the chimpanzees.</description>

		<description>Another problem that wild chimpanzees face is the bushmeat trade. Bushmeat refers to the non-traditional killing of non-game wild animals for meat. Although you and I could never imagine eating a chimpanzee, some people consider them a delicacy. But, bushmeat can contain diseases putting the consumer at risk.  In some areas, it is a cultural tradition to hunt for animals, including chimpanzees, in the local forests. 

These people have been hunting chimpanzees for generations, and changing ideas that have been around for so long is no easy task. However, the chimpanzee is an endangered animal and, if you have read some of the previous pages, there are many ways in which we are similar. It is exceedingly important that we as a human race work to stop traditional hunting of our cousins, the chimpanzees, in order to ensure their future existence in the wild.

The bushmeat trade also contributes to the selling of live chimpanzees for entertainment or other purposes. When mothers are hunted and killed for meat, the babies are often taken and sold to people who want to use them for entertainment or as pets.

There are many difficulties encountered when trying to fight the killing of and trade of chimpanzees for bushmeat and entertainment purposes. A lot of money can be made from this trade because of the demand for chimpanzee meat in some areas, and many people will illegally kill chimpanzees out of desperation to support themselves and their family. An important step that can help to reduce bushmeat trade is educating the local people of alternative practices and trades that can be used to support their families. We also have to work to educate people about the chimpanzees themselves. We need to clearly show the close relation between people and chimpanzees in a positive way. With education, we as humans can hopefully ignite and fuel a love of chimpanzees in  hearts and minds of our own species, and, as a result, reduce the demand for prevalence of the bushmeat trade.

When people are caught illegally hunting chimpanzees, they are punished, but no punishment is severe enough to make up for the killing of this beautiful, amazing, and endangered relative of ours. It is also very hard to enforce the laws because people can sneak in and out of the forest without being caught. As deforestation by logging companies becomes more prevalent, a problem for chimpanzees in itself, access in and out of the forests becomes increasingly easier. Park rangers and law enforcement officials need extra support to help fight against the bushmeat trade.</description>
